You are encouraged to follow the steps you learned throughout this UX UI course. Therefore, you will be expected to create a solution to the problem, a persona, a journey map, wireframes and an interactive high-fidelity prototype.

## Description of problem

The Little Lemon website currently does not allow reservations to be booked from the site. The owners of the restaurant
would like to allow customers to make a reservation online.

The reservation system will include a button on the homepage to `Reserve a table` and provide them a page displaying a
calendar where they can see the current availability and select an open data and time to make a reservation.

Once a reservation has been made, the user will be shown a confirmation page and receive an email confirming their
reservation date and time.
